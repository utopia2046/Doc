# Beginning Game AI with Unity, Programming Artificial Intelligence with CSharp

Source Code: <https://github.com/Apress/beginning-game-ai-unity>

## Basics

### Intelligent Agent

- Processing perceived information from environment
- Taking action in order to reach a specific goal

`P* -> A`

- `P*`: percept sequence
- `A`: appropriate action

### Finite State Machine (FSM) for NPCs

- Easy to implement
- Low impact on performances
- Genuine and credible user experience when will designed

### Artificial Life (AL) Game: 'Creatures' series by Steve Grand

- genetics algorithms
- neural networks
- create virtual-biological beings
- transmit their genetic traits to offspring by mating
- learn by experience

### Move and Turn

movement vector like this:

`myObject.transform.Translate(0, 0, speed * Time.deltaTime);`

and turn the object to face the target position:

`this.transform.LookAt(positionToLookAt);`

There are two very popular techniques to implement linear interpolation to rotate an object:

- `Lerp` (Linear intERPolation)
- `Slerp` (Spherical Linear intERPolation)

For example, use slerp to calculate rotation:

`Quaternion.Slerp(startingRotation, goalRotation, rotationSpeed);`

## Paths and Waypoints

Waypoints are points on a line of travel that mark specific locations. By connecting waypoint to waypoint we could define a path and guide GameObject to walk along the path.

``` csharp
public class WalkWayPoints : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject[] path; // fill path array with waypoint objects in Editor

    private Vector3 goal;
    private float speed = 4.0f;
    private float accuracy = 0.5f;
    private float rotSpeed = 4f;
    private int curNode = 0;

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // get current target waypoint
        goal = new Vector3(
            path[curNode].transform.position.x,
            this.transform.position.y,
            path[curNode].transform.position.z);
        Vector3 direction = goal - this.transform.position;

        if (direction.magnitude > accuracy)
        {
            // turn and move agent toward target waypoint
            this.transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(
                this.transform.rotation,
                Quaternion.LookRotation(direction),
                Time.deltaTime * rotSpeed);
            this.transform.Translate(0, 0, speed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
        else // reach target node, update curNode
        {
            if (curNode < path.Length - 1)
            {
                curNode++;
            }
            else // loop path array
            {
                curNode = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Navigation

Broad-First & Depth-First Search (BFS & DFS)

Unweighted & Weighted Graph

Unity implements weighted graphs for navigation using a solution thatâ€™s widely appreciated and used in the game industry: the Navigation Mesh `NavMesh`.

A Navigation Mesh `NavMesh` is a collection of **convex polygons** that mark the walkable areas on surfaces in a 3D space. Much like WayPoints, NavMeshes are represented internally as graphs so that graph algorithms can be used to solve pathfinding problems.

In Unity Editor, select parent of all floor and walls, select `Navigation Static` in Inspector. This will tell Unity to consider the parent GameObject and all its children as static objects, part of the navigable 3D space. The consequence of this setting is that, when a NavMesh will be baked, Unity will consider all the 3D objects marked as `Navigation Static` and decide if they are walkable or reachable.

Open navigation panel: `Window` -> `AI` -> `Navigation`, select `Bake` tab, confirm the agent size and click `Bake` to see the mesh
