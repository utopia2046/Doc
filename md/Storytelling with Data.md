# Storytelling with Data, A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals

## Overview

1. Understand the context
2. Choose an appopriate visual display
3. Eliminate clutter
4. Focus attention where you want it
5. Think like a designer
6. Tell a story

## Understand the Context

Exploratory vs. Explanatory analysis. Resist the temptation to show all exploratory and show **only explanatory** result in report.

Context:

* Who: specific target audience, who is decision maker?
* What: what do you want your audience to know or do?
* How: what data is available that will help, make my point? suggesting possible next steps.

These communication with data need to take a more confident stance when it comes to making specific observations and recommendations based on their analysis.

## Choosing an Effective Visual

Let data take center stage and design fade into background.

* Simple text
  + only few number
  + need to emphasize
* Table
  + details
  + not good for presentation
* Heat Map
  + table with colored cells to convey relative magnitude
  + comparing with wide color spectrum, use color saturation makes the chart more readable
* Scatterplot
  + more used in scientific fields
  + complicated for people with less understanding
* Line
  + plot continuous data over time
  + try line plot for AVG series together with area plot for MIN/MAX
* Slopegraph
  + increase/decrease in rate of change
* Bar
  + categorical data
  + easy to understand
  + bar chart should always has a zero baseline
  + use multiple series bar chart with caution
* Waterfall chart
  + starting point, increase & decrease, result ending point
* Horizontal bar chart
  + many categories
  + category name long
  + category data series should always be ordered
  + various: 100% stacked horizontal bar chart
* Area
  + for data with vast scale difference

To be avoided

* Pie charts are evil (so are donut charts), use bar chart instead
* Don't use 3D
* Second Y-axis

When display 2 datasets against same axis, it can imply a relationship that may or may not exist.

| FOCUS: What do you need your audience to know?

## Clutter is your enemy

Anything that isn't adding informative value, add cognitive load

### Gestalt principle of visual perception

* proximity
* similarity
* enclosure
* closure
* continuity
* connection

### 完形理论

我们习惯以规则、有序、对称和简单的方式把不同的元素加以简单的组织。一个不断组织、简化、统一的过程，产生出易于理解协调的整体。

* create clean lines of elements & white spaces
* diagonal elements such as lines & text should be avoided
* get more comfortable with white space, use white space strategically for emphasis
* clear contrast helps audiences to focus

### Pre-attentive attributes signal where to look

* color
* size
* location
* orientation
* shape
* length
* width
* hue
* intensity
* motion

### Build a visual hierarchy

iconic memory -> short term memory -> long term memory

### Use color wisely

* Sparingly
* Consistently
* Design with color-blind in mind
* Be thoughtful of the tone conveys
* Consider whether to leverage brand color

### Check if an element is potential distraction

* Not all data are equally important
* When detail isn't needed, summarize
* Ask yourself, would eliminating this change anything?
* Push necessary, but non-message-impacting items to the background (gray or light axis and grid)

### Tips on Text

If there is a conclusion you want your audience to reach, state it in words.

* Make it legible
* Keep it clean
* Use straight forward language
* Remove unnecessary complexity

## 3 minutes story

Big Idea:

1. It must articulate your unique point of view;
2. It must convery what's at stake;
3. It must be a complete sentence;

## How to ask for help

Check your assumptions that block you from asking for help:

* Negative associations
* Self-criticism
* Concerns about how you will be perceived
* Self-sacrificing beliefs
* Overestimating the likelihood of rejection

People might actually like you more if they've done you a favor.

Expressing vulnerability and openess, by acknowledgeing that you could use help, can lead to deeper connection.

### Tips for asking help

* Choose whom to ask
* Consider the best time to ask, more preferable in person if you can, face to face foster a sense of connection.
* Flighting discomfort:
  + fear of disapproval
  + guilt, shame or embarrassment
  + anxiety about not having control
* Use assertive communication skills (honest and open)
* Be as clear as possible about what you need.
* Don't make it as a sales pitch or as or as pleeding, instead, simply state the reason behind the request. Also, no need to apologise or minimise your request, nor to offer something in return.
* If someone agrees to help, let them, and receive it gracefully.
* Giving someone **true freedom** to choose
* If ther request is denied, consider other options.

### Example

* I've been struggling with ..., would you be willing to ...?
* Could you help me out by ...?
* I was wondering if you could do me a favour and ...?
* Could you please ... for me next Tuesday?

If you do succeed in persuading them, you've only done so on an intellectual basis. That's not good enough, because people are not inspired to act by reason alone.
Robert McKee, Story

## How to write with style, Kurt Vonnegut

1. Find a subject you care about
2. Do not ramble, though
3. Keep it simple
4. Have the guts to cut
5. Sound like yourself
6. Say what you meant to say
7. Pity the readers

## Story-Telling with Data

### 1st Act: sets up story

* Subjective expectation meets cruel reality
* Protagonist/relationships/world
* Incident -> First Turning Point (Life will never be the same)
* Call to action

### 2nd Act: attempt to resolve the problem

Keypoints:

* Conflict
* Tension

Chracter Arc

* Protagonist lacks the skills to deal with the problem
* Increasingly worsening situations
* Learn new skills
* Reach a higher sense of awareness

### 3rd Act: resolve the story

* Climax: tensions of the story reach the highest point of intensity
* Dramatic question answered

## Presentation logic

### Horizontal logic

* Executive summary
  + A
  + B
  + C
* A
* B
* C

### Vertical logic

All information on a give slide is self-reinforcing

### Reverse storyboarding

### A fresh perspective

## 3-As Principle

* Affordances: designed to only have one way to use correctly
* Accessibility
* Aesthetics

1. Highlight the important stuff
2. Eliminate distractions
3. Create a clear hierarchy of information

You know you've achieved perfection, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing to take away.

* Be smart with color
* Pay attention to alignment
* Leverage white space

The design that you don't even notice when they are done well. But you notice when they aren't.
